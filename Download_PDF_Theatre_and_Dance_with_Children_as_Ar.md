This book offers a methodological framework for developing research-based Theatre and Dance for the Very Young (TDVY) performances in which artists collaborate with children ages 0-6 and their caregivers and/or educators as creative partners in the process. It provides a detailed investigation of all stages of the work including: designing and executing a creative research plan, analyzing tools for assessment, using research results as the foundation of a devising process, and outcomes for final performances for this age range. This process reflects on years of creative research with very young children, the results of which include methods for building collaborative performances with a variety of institutions such as early childhood centers, universities, community spaces, and non-profit arts organizations. The main themes addressed in this book are innovative methods for devising and collaboration, the translation of research into performance, and the integral bonds between early childhood development and artistic experiences.
