The complete run of the groundbreaking young adult vampire series created by Moto Hagio, a shojo/shonen-ai manga pioneer and one of the worldâ€™s most influential cartoonists.The Poe Clan: a race of undead that feeds on the energy of the living, whiling away the centuries in a village of roses where time and geography have no meaning. Circumstances lead to a brother and sister, Edgar and Marybelle, being initiated into the clan too young, and therefore doomed to live out eternity forever on the brink of adulthood until a wooden stake or a silver bullet should cut them down. The Poe Clanâ€™s narrative spans the mid-1700s to the 1970s: generations of humansâ€™ lives are profoundly affected by Edgar, Marybelle, and Alan Twilight, a 14-year-old whom Edgar embraces in the 1800s. In this groundbreaking manga, Moto Hagio explores what it means to live and die, to have loved and lost. Fantagraphics is proud to present the complete 1970s run of this best-selling manga series in English for the first time. Please note: This title is a traditional work of manga and reads back to front and right to left.
