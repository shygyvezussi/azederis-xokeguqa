Overview
In this powerful, all-encompassing YA love story, a girl who becomes a grim reaper must figure out what the future holdsâ€”especially when it comes to the girlfriend she left behind.

 When Ashana Persaud meets Poppy Morgan on a school trip, sheâ€™s sure itâ€™s too good to be true. Ash has never had much luck with girls, but Poppy proves different. Coffee dates turn to museum trips until, soon, the two girls can see a future togetherâ€”one thatâ€™s seemingly snatched from them when a hit-and-run takes Ashâ€™s life on New Yearâ€™s Eve.

 As the last person to die before midnight, Ash is bestowed the title of reaper, tasked with finding lost souls and helping them cross over. Only those close to death can perceive a reaper, so when Ash runs into Poppy one lonely nightâ€”and Poppy recognizes herâ€”they can&#039;t be sure if it&#039;s the second chance they&#039;ve so desperately wished for, or a tragedy lying in wait.
