 I&#039;ve awakened my powers, and things are not well.
 
 When I turned twenty years old, I discovered I had horrifying secret powers, got trapped into marriage with my enemies, accidentally joined a cult, and signed up for a bloodthirsty Gladiator Competition. To make matters worse, my terrifying husbands are trying to seduce me, and my old mentors are acting really strange.
 
 Now, someone is killing Olympiansâ€”and itâ€™s not Titans. Things are spiraling out of control.
 
 Iâ€™m fighting for my life and drowning in secrets.
