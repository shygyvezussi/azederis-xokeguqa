‚ÄúPeople talk about football managers being under pressure. Trust me, that&#039;s nothing. Pressure is watching one of your drivers hit a barrier at 190mph and exploding before your eyes...‚Äù

 In Surviving to Drive, Haas team principal Guenther Steiner brings readers inside his Formula 1 team for the entirety of the 2022 season, giving an unobstructed view of what really takes place behind the scenes. Through this unique lens, Steiner guides readers on the thrilling rollercoaster of life at the heart of high-stakes motor racing. Packed full of twists and turns, from pre-season preparations to hiring and firing drivers, from the design, launch, and testing of a car to the race calendar itself‚ÄìSurviving to Drive is the first time that an Formula 1 team has allowed an acting team principal to tell the full story of a whole season.

 Uncompromising and searingly honest, told in Steiner&#039;s inimitable style, Surviving to Drive is a fascinating and hugely entertaining account of the realities of running a Formula 1 team.
