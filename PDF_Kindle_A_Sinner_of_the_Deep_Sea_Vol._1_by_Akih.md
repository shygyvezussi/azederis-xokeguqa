Overview
The ocean covers about 70 percent of the earthâ€™s surfaceâ€”a whole world, yet unknown to humanityâ€¦and in its depths a nation, thousands of meters beneath the waves. There, the mermaid Jo has been whiling away her days in peace. But that tranquility is shattered when her friend Ryuu is imprisoned for breaking the gravest of undersea laws: Their existence must be kept hidden from the people above. But why would Ryuu let the secret slip? And who did she tell? The curtain rises on Joâ€™s adventure to save her friendâ€”and on a story of loveâ€¦?!
