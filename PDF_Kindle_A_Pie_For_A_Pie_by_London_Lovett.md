Overview
It&#039;s a crisp autumn in Ripple Creek, and Scottie Ramone is busy baking pumpkin pies for the town&#039;s pie eating contest. Business is great, but her social life is still in tatters. She&#039;s avoiding one man and the other has left town for a very prolonged book tour. She knows definitively which way her heart is leaning, but is it too late?
 
 In the meantime, the pie contest ends in disaster when one of the contestants dies right after eating her pie. Scottie is desperate to find the killer and clear her name, but there are many directions to turn, and it seems everyone has a motive. Customers are canceling their holiday orders, and if Scottie doesn&#039;t solve the case soon, her bakery will be ruined.
